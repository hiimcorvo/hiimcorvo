- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ethan Li, an early career cheminformatician
- ðŸ‘€ I've learned a few things in my relatively short career, and I'm hoping to create something useful to you and your efforts to further science.
- ðŸŒ± The repositories I am creating may already exist, and have limited usefulness. Nevertheless, I think a place to for me to deposit some of the ideas I have accrued will be useful. Who knows, I may also start a blog like Pat Walter's blog which I've found to be quite useful to me personally. Anyways, enough rambling. 

<!---
hiimcorvo/hiimcorvo is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
